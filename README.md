# project_OS

I did this project as a part of Operating System subject.
# OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to make an mobile expense tracker application
which is customised according to Operating System i.e Android and IOS.
The application is developed on flutter SDK which runs on the language Dart.
Flutter is a cross-platform SDK which helps to maintain a single-code base for
both android and IOS.
Our objective is to make an application on flutter and customize it according to the
Operating System and see the difference in their UI and performance in both
operating systems.
We will also understand how an application interacts with different operating
systems.
 
# PROPOSED WORK
In the project, we have built a mobile application customised for IOS and Android.
Our application includes 4 pages.
Users can simply click the add transaction button to add a new entry and specify the
amount and the date.
Also,we have provided an option to add comments and a picture with it.
The user can delete the record by simply clicking the delete icon.
On clicking a transaction, the user will navigate to a new page which will show the
details of the transaction like amount,title,date,a picture and a comment if added.
The second bottomNavigationTab is used to show the statistical analysis of the
transactions which will show average expenditure per day ,expenditure in a week and
expenditure in the last 30 days.
